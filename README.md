## Intro:
This Repo simplifies generating annual heat and electricity load profiles using Demandlib Python [https://github.com/oemof/demandlib].
## usage:
	* First download the python file [demandlib_gui_v2.py].
 	* Install all the requirements in your environment.
  	* Open the file into any IDE and run it.
   	* A window appears for inputs.
    * Navigate to the appropriate tab and enter your inputs.
    * Then press the 'Load inputs' button and verify your data.
    * Press the 'Simulate' button.
For a detailed overview of each input, follow [user guide.pdf]

## Note:
The project is designed and built for master thesis purposes. Hence, this GUI is not a full-scale interface for Demandlib python.
Most of the capabilities of this tool are built to address the master thesis requirements and further solve OEMOF models. 
While the Demandlib python can do much more. read documentation [https://demandlib.readthedocs.io/]

 You can adjust the code lines in the program according to your requirements.

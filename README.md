## Note:
The project is designed and built for master thesis purposes. Hence, this GUI is not a full-scale interface for Demandlib python.
Most of the capabilities of this tool are built to address the master thesis requirements and further solve OEMOF models. 
While the Demandlib python can do much more. read documentation [https://demandlib.readthedocs.io/]

 You can adjust the code lines in the program according to your requirements.
